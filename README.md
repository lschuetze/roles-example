# roles-example
A simple Role Object Pattern implementation

This is [part of an answer I gave on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32095830/java-can-i-extend-an-instance-of-a-class-to-make-it-a-parent-class-instance/32100657#32100657)
regarding the ability to add behavior during runtime. The question was if you can add abilities to a dog right into the class at runtime, e.g., that the dogs learns to jump (and can forget about it).

Using the [Role Object Pattern](http://hillside.net/plop/plop97/Proceedings/riehle.pdf) I demonstrated how to build the foundation for a runtime variable implementation.
